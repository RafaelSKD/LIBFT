🎉 Welcome to Libft! 🎉
Welcome to Libft, my first big project from the 42 school! 🎓 This is a personal library written in C, featuring a variety of functions that are handy for any C programmer. This library helped me understand the magic behind many of the functions we use every day. ✨

📚 What is Libft?
Libft is a collection of useful C functions and data structures. It started as a basic exercise, but I enjoyed it so much that I decided to add some bonus features, including the implementation of linked lists! 🧩

Here's a quick overview of what you'll find in this library:

📂 Functions
String Manipulation: ft_strlen, ft_strchr, ft_strjoin, ft_substr, etc.
Memory Operations: ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_bzero, etc.
Character Checks: ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isprint, etc.
Conversion: ft_atoi, ft_itoa, etc.
File Output: ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, etc.
📋 Bonus Features
Linked Lists: Implementations of t_list and functions like ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstmap, etc.
🚀 Getting Started
To get started with Libft, you'll need to compile it using the included Makefile.

🤓 What I Learned
Makefile Mastery: I learned how to use Makefiles to automate the build process. If I can do it, you can too! 💪
Function Implementations: I implemented common C functions from scratch and got a better understanding of how they work.
Linked Lists: Adding bonus features, I learned how to work with linked lists, which are fundamental in many algorithms.
🤔 Why Did I Do This?
Because I was driven by curiosity and the desire to learn! 🛠️ Plus, it’s always fun to create something from scratch and see it grow.

🕵️‍♂️ Known Issues
If you encounter any bugs, please submit an issue or a pull request. I’m still learning, and every bit of feedback helps!
🎁 Acknowledgements
A huge thank you to 42 and the amazing community for the support and the resources that made this project possible! 🚀

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this library. Happy coding! 💻

😂 A Little Joke to Wrap It Up
Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🦟

Happy coding! 😄
