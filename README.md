# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Libft! ðŸŽ‰  

**Welcome to Libft, my first big adventure at 42 School!** ðŸŽ“  
This is a personal library written in C, packed with useful functions that every C programmer will find handy. This project gave me a deep dive into the magic behind the functions we use every dayâ€”and taught me just how much fun coding can be! âœ¨

## ðŸ“š What is Libft?  
Libft is a collection of custom-built C functions and data structures. It began as a simple exercise but quickly grew into something much more exciting! I even added **bonus features** like linked lists for extra fun. ðŸ§©  

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s inside:  

### ðŸ“‚ Core Functions  
- **String Manipulation**:  
  `ft_strlen`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_substr`, and more.  
- **Memory Operations**:  
  `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_bzero`, etc.  
- **Character Checks**:  
  `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isprint`, and more.  
- **Conversion**:  
  `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`, and beyond.  
- **File Output**:  
  `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, etc.  

### ðŸ“‹ Bonus Features  
- **Linked Lists**:  
  Implementations of `t_list` and functions like `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstmap`, and more!

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
